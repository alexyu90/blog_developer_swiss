## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

As a Python-focused developer starting a career in Switzerland, I would like to use the StackOverflow 2019 dataset to answer some questions of personal interests.

### This analysis aims to answer the following questions:
- Career in Switzerland:
    - **1. Language**: Is Python a good language to start with as a developer? Answer in terms of Employment, Job Satisfaction, Career Satisfaction and Salary. How does it compare to other popular languages (Javascript, HTML/CSS, SQL, Java)?
    - **2. Growth**: How do Career Satisfaction and Salary grow with experience? Python vs. General?
- Career in Switzerland vs. in Germany, UK, US: 
    - **3. Country**: How do Job Satisfaction and Salary of python developers in Switzerland compare to those in Germany, UK, US?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is the notebook file available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

The pdf file is the survey used. The dataset is too large for github, so please find them in the link below.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@yu90/are-developers-with-python-skills-in-switzerland-happy-and-well-paid-5a188ed04181).
